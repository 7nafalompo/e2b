# How to Play Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition Without CD
 
Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition is an action-adventure game that was released in 2015 for PC and consoles. It is an enhanced version of the original Devil May Cry 4 game, featuring new playable characters, modes, costumes, and improvements. However, some PC users may encounter a problem when trying to play the game without the CD or DVD. This is because the game uses a copy protection system called SecuROM that checks for the presence of the disc in the drive.

Fortunately, there is a way to bypass this restriction and play Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition without CD. This involves using a No-CD crack, which is a modified version of the game's executable file that removes the disc check. A No-CD crack can be downloaded from various websites that offer game fixes and trainers, such as GameCopyWorld[^1^] or MegaGames[^3^]. However, before using a No-CD crack, you should always make a backup of your original game files and use a firewall to block any online connections from the game.
 
To use a No-CD crack for Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, follow these steps:
 
1. Install the game normally from the CD or DVD.
2. Download a No-CD crack that matches your game version and language from a trusted source. For example, you can download a No-CD crack for Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition v1.0 [MULTI6] from GameCopyWorld[^1^].
3. Extract the contents of the No-CD crack archive to a folder on your computer.
4. Copy the cracked executable file (usually named DMC4SE.exe) from the No-CD crack folder to your game installation folder (usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition\Binaries\Win32).
5. Replace the original executable file when prompted.
6. Run the game from the cracked executable file or create a shortcut to it on your desktop.
7. Enjoy playing Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition without CD!

Note: Some No-CD cracks may also include additional features, such as trainers or unlockers, that can modify the game's behavior or give you access to extra content. However, these features may not work properly or may cause compatibility issues with your system. Use them at your own risk and discretion.
